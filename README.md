# RideSharing

## Inspiration
The current system that OLA and UBER offer are exceedingly expensive and not feasible for short distance rides.
## What it does
My project removes the middleman from the scenario by just having the drivers and users interact on a decentralized platform.
## How we built it
Smart contracts were written in soliidty
## Challenges we ran into
Deciding what data to store on-chain.
## What's next for RideShare
An engaging frontend, as well as a system update including a car renting system.
